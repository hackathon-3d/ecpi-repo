        Springs are the best source of water in the woods, but are hard to come by and are not likely to actually be found.
        \nRunning water is a good source of water because it is likely to have less sediment.
		\nPlant Roots are a good source of water.  To prepare them:
		\n\t&#8226;Dig or pry the roots out of the ground
		\n\t&#8226;Cut the roots into short pieces
		\n\t&#8226;Smash the pieces so the moisture runs out
		\n\t&#8226;Catch the liquid in a container.
		\n&#9734;IMPORTANT NOTE:\tAll water should be purified by brining it to a rolling boil and letting it boil for three minutes.

        Insects contain 65&#8211;80% protein, and are a great source of food.
		\nAvoid eating:
		\n\t&#8226;Insects that bite or have stingers
		\n\t&#8226;Insects that are hairy or bright colored
		\n\t&#8226;Insects that have a pugnant odor
		\n\t&#8226;spiders, ticks and mosquitoes as they carry diseases
		\nCook insects with hard shells as they often carry parasites, and remove any wings and legs before eating.
		\nWorms are also a good source of protien.  They can be found in damp humus soil.  Worms put in clean potable water will purge themselves of toxins and dirt, and can be eatten raw.
		\nFish are also a good sorce of food if they are available.  Minnows can be eatten whole.
		\n&#9734;Important Note:\tThe larger the mammal, the more damage it can do to you.  Avoid hunting large mammals unless well armed or experienced.
