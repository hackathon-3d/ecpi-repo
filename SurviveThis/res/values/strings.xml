    <string name="hydration">Hydration:</string>
    <string name="woods_hydration">        Springs are the best source of water in the woods, but are hard to come by and are not likely to actually be found.
        \nRunning water is a good source of water because it is likely to have less sediment.
		\nPlant Roots are a good source of water.  To prepare them:
		\n\t&#8226;Dig or pry the roots out of the ground
		\n\t&#8226;Cut the roots into short pieces
		\n\t&#8226;Smash the pieces so the moisture runs out
		\n\t&#8226;Catch the liquid in a container.
		\n&#9734;IMPORTANT NOTE:\tAll water should be purified by brining it to a rolling boil and letting it boil for three minutes.
		\n</string>
    <string name="snow_hydration">    	Snow and ice must be melted and brought to boiling for 3 minutes to purify
        \n&#9734;IMPORTANT NOTE:\tDo not eat snow without melting first! This will bring down your body temperature and can lead to further dehydration.
        \nIf you are near the sea remember, the more crystalline and blue the ice is, the less salt it has.</string>

    <string name="food">Procuring Food:</string>
    <string name="woods_food">        Insects contain 65&#8211;80% protein, and are a great source of food.
		\nAvoid eating:
		\n\t&#8226;Insects that bite or have stingers
		\n\t&#8226;Insects that are hairy or bright colored
		\n\t&#8226;Insects that have a pugnant odor
		\n\t&#8226;spiders, ticks and mosquitoes as they carry diseases
		\nCook insects with hard shells as they often carry parasites, and remove any wings and legs before eating.
		\nWorms are also a good source of protien.  They can be found in damp humus soil.  Worms put in clean potable water will purge themselves of toxins and dirt, and can be eatten raw.
		\nFish are also a good sorce of food if they are available.  Minnows can be eatten whole.
		\n&#9734;Important Note:\tThe larger the mammal, the more damage it can do to you.  Avoid hunting large mammals unless well armed or experienced.
		\n</string>
    <string name="snow_food">    	If near water, fish can still be caught - although it may be ice fishing that is needed.
        \nAnimals that can be hunted:
        \n\t&#8226;Musk Ox
        \n\t\t&#8226;Musk Ox are one of the largest arctic mammals and are peaceful but defend their young. 
        \n\t&#8226;Reindeer
        \n\t\t&#8226;Reindeer have been domesticated by arctic human populations as a source of food, clothing, and shelter.
        \n\t&#8226;Caribou
        \n\t\t&#8226;Caribou have never been domesticated, but can make a good food source for a skilled hunter.

        \nFoxes:
        \n\t&#8226;Arctic foxes often follow polar bears to feed off of what the bears leave behind.
        \nWolves:
        \n\t&#8226;Arctic wolves are usually found near caribou and can kill and adult caribou with one bite to the neck.</string>
